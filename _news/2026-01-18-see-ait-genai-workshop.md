We are co-organizing the **1st International Workshop on Software Engineering for the GenAI Transformation (SEE-AIT 2026)**, a full-day event co-located with **FSE 2026** in Montreal on **July 5, 2026**.

The workshop focuses on how software engineering can guide organizational GenAI transformation in a socio-technical, human-centric way, bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss methods, architectures, and empirical evidence for responsible GenAI integration.

More details and the Call for Papers are available on the [SEE-AIT website](https://seeait.github.io/) and on the [SEE-AIT LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/see-ait).
